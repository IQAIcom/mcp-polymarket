## 📖 Overview

The Polymarket MCP Server enables AI agents to interact with [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com), a leading prediction market platform on Polygon. This server provides comprehensive access to market data, real-time pricing, order books, and trading capabilities through the Polymarket API.

By implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), this server allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover prediction markets, analyze odds (probabilities), execute trades, and track portfolio positions directly through their context window, bridging the gap between AI and decentralized prediction markets.

## ✨ Features

*   **Market Discovery**: Search and filter prediction markets by keywords, tags, and status.
*   **Real-time Pricing**: Access live price data, implied probabilities, and depth-of-market (order books) for any outcome token.
*   **Trading Capabilities**: Place limit orders, market orders, and manage open orders (requires private key).
*   **Portfolio Tracking**: Monitor user positions, trade history, and balances for specific wallet addresses.
*   **Order Management**: View, cancel, and manage open orders across all markets.
